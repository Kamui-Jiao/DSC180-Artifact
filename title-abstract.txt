Nowadays, smartphone is an indispensable part of people’s daily life.Android System is the most popular system running on smartphone.  Dueto this popularity, malware detection on Android becomes on of the mostsignificant  task  for  research  community.   In  this  project,  we  are  mainlyfocusing on one called MAMADROID System.  Instead of previous workwhich highly relied on the permissions requested by apps, MAMADROIDrelied on the sequences of abstracted API calls performed by apps.  Weare very interested in this model and really want to explore deeper intoit.  To achieve this, we’ve been trying produce our own malware detectionmodel based on the idea of MAMADROID. Basically what we’ve done isWe made three basic model and take the one with the highest accuracyand made two more advanced model based on this model with the bestperformance.
