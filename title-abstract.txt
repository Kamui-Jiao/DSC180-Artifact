Title:
Create a Malware Detection Model Based on the idea of MAMADROID System.

Abstract:
Nowadays, smartphone is an indispensable part of people’s daily life. Android System is the most popular system running on smartphone. Due to this popularity, malware detection on Android becomes one of the most significant task for research community. In this project, we are mainly focusing on one called MAMADROID System. Instead of previous work which highly relied on the permissions requested by apps, MAMADROID relied on the sequences of abstracted API calls performed by apps. We are very interested in this model and really want to explore deeper into it. To achieve this, we’ve been trying produce our own malware detection model based on the idea of MAMADROID. Basically what we’ve done is making three basic model and taking the one with the highest accuracy and making two more advanced model based on the model with the highest performance.
